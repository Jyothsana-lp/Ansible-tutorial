# Ansible-tutorial Day 1 - Introduction to Ansible
Every organization has a system Admins .. and their responsibility will be maintenance , making sure if distribution version, system , application version is up -to date ...

Puppet, Chef, and Ansible are configuration management tools that automate infrastructure and software deployments. They help ensure consistent configurations across multiple systems, streamline deployments, and reduce manual errors. While all three achieve similar goals, they differ in their approaches and architectures

The puppet or chef will act as an interface b/w servers and sys admins and they will orchestrate the required tasks .
Ansible --> For ansible we need to know YAML code which is standard template used in the industry. We can write playbooks and its agentless . We need not install any agents to do orchestration.
